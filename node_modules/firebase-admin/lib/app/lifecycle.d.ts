/**
 * Initializes the `App` instance.
 *
 * Creates a new instance of {@link App} if one doesn't exist, or returns an existing
 * `App` instance if one exists with the same `appName` and `options`.
 *
 * Note, due to the inablity to compare `http.Agent` objects and `Credential` objects,
 * this function cannot support idempotency if either of `options.httpAgent` or
 * `options.credential` are defined. When either is defined, subsequent invocations will
 * throw a `FirebaseAppError` instead of returning an `App` object.
 *
 * For example, to safely initialize an app that may already exist:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * let app;
 * try {
 *   app = getApp("myApp");
 * } catch (error) {
 *   app = initializeApp({ credential: myCredential }, "myApp");
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param options - Optional A set of {@link AppOptions} for the `App` instance.
 *   If not present, `initializeApp` will try to initialize with the options from the
 *   `FIREBASE_CONFIG` environment variable. If the environment variable contains a
 *   string that starts with `{` it will be parsed as JSON, otherwise it will be
 *   assumed to be pointing to a file.
 * @param appName - Optional name of the `App` instance.
 *
 * @returns A new App instance, or the existing App if the instance already exists with
 *   the provided configuration.
 *
 * @throws FirebaseAppError if an `App` with the same name has already been
 *   initialized with a different set of `AppOptions`.
 * @throws FirebaseAppError if an existing `App` exists and `options.httpAgent`
 *   or `options.credential` are defined. This is due to the function's inability to
 *   determine if the existing `App`'s `options` equate to the `options` parameter
 *   of this function. It's recommended to use {@link getApp} or {@link getApps} if your
 *   implementation uses either of these two fields in `AppOptions`.
